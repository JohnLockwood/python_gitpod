Proof of Concept for Python + Jupyter + Gitpod

[Open on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/JohnLockwood/python_gitpod)

## To do

This is based on https://linuxtut.com/en/dbb64871480cf1a06acf/

I think some more automation could have been done in that article.  Manual steps are as follows:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

## To use Jupyter Lab

```
jupyter lab
```
